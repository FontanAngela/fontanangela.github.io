Finally, after two years of delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is time again for [Reglermöte](https://www.ltu.se/research/subjects/control/Reglermote?l=en), the conference of the Swedish Engineers in Control, a forum for contacts between industry and universities.
This year, Reglermöte is held at Luleå University of Technology, on June 7-9 2022.

This conference is a great opportunity not only to learn about the research projects promoted by different Swedish universities in collaboration with Industry, but also to establish social connections which hopefully can lead to future collaborations.

I have been invited to give a short talk about my research work at the [EECS summer event](https://www.kth.se/eecs-summerevent-2022) June 8, 2022, at KTH Main Campus.

Thanks to a diverse [list of speakers](https://www.kth.se/eecs-summerevent-2022/standarddept/speakers-2022-1.1158933), one from each division, we could listen and be informed on the wide research footprint of EECS.
I am glad I was chosen to be part of such a fun and interactive event! :)

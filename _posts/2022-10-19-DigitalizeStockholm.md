[Digitalize in Stockholm (DiS)](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/event/digitalize-in-stockholm-2022-day-1/) is an annual conference and meeting place for global 
thought leaders and rising stars in academia, industry, government, and civil society – all engaged in digital transformation. This year's event, [Digitalize in Stockholm 2022](https://digitalizeinsthlm22.se/), is a hybrid event, hosted by [Digital Futures](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/).

I am very excited to attend this event and, together with Prof. [Hedvig Kjellström](https://www.kth.se/profile/hedvig), present our case study in the [Humazing the Sustainable Smart City (HiSS) Project](https://sites.google.com/view/hiss-digitalfutures/home) 
during the [RESEARCH BREAK-OUT SESSION 2: Smart Society](https://digitalizeinsthlm22.se/program/) on October 19.

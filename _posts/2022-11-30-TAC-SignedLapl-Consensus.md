**Abstract:**
Laplacian dynamics on signed digraphs have a richer behavior than those on nonnegative digraphs. 
In particular, for the so-called “repelling” signed Laplacians, the marginal stability property (needed to achieve consensus) 
is not guaranteed a priori and, even when it holds, it does not automatically lead to consensus, 
as these signed Laplacians may lose rank even in strongly connected digraphs. Furthermore, in the time-varying case, 
instability can occur even when switching in a family of systems each of which corresponds to a marginally stable signed Laplacian 
with the correct corank. In this paper we present novel conditions for achieving consensus on signed digraphs based on the property 
of eventual positivity, a Perron-Frobenius type of property for signed matrices. The conditions we develop cover both time-invariant 
and time-varying cases. A particularly simple sufficient condition, valid in both cases, is that the Laplacians are normal matrices. 
Such condition can be relaxed in several ways. For instance, in the time-invariant case it is enough that the Laplacian has this 
Perron-Frobenius property on the right side, but not on the left side (i.e., on the transpose). For the time-varying case, 
convergence to consensus can be guaranteed by the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the signed Laplacians. 
All conditions can be easily extended to bipartite consensus.
